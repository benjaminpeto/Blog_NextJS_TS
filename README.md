This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# Summary

The project includes fetching a [FakeAPI](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) endpoint for blog posts with the built-in `getServerSideProps` and rendering them on the main page. There you can choose the post you'd like to read, and with dynamic routing the single post will show up on their corresponding pages.

_The styling of this website remain almost the same as your `create-next-app` would look like after initiation._

In this project, I learnt how to use `getServerSideProps`, `getServerSidePropsContext`, `getStaticProps`, `Layout`, `Link`, `Head`, `dynamic routes`, `css-modules` with **TypeScript** in NextJS.

## Getting Started

First, clone this project to your local environment. Then run the following scripts in your CLI.

```bash
cd ./into/the/folder
npm install # or yarn add
npm run dev # or yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
